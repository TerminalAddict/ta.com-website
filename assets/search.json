But I never felt particularly safe.

Britomart train station in Auckland city has only two rail platforms, which are feed by only one line.\nWhich means the art of catching a train out of Auckland (for those of us who haven\u2019t done it before) is a bit tricky.\nIn all the major cities I\u2019ve been to around the world train platforms aren\u2019t really shared. At Waterloo I went to the same south west trains platform everyday to get to Surrey. In Auckland because of the shared platform set up, it\u2019s quite easy to get on the wrong train.\nOh well. No biggie, just need to change at the next stop.\nAlso, I cocked up day one of using the ATHOP card, which fortunately was only a $10 lesson :) I didn\u2019t tag on, so when I tagged off the system didn\u2019t use monthly pass. How daft! I just put $195 on a card but the system says \u201cnope - I\u2019m gonna charge you, instead of using your unlimited use pass\u201d - Stupid Auckland transport !!!!\nAnyway, I guess I\u2019ll get in a rhythm soon enough :)\n\t\t  "},{"url":"https:\/\/www.loudas.com\/general%20life\/2013\/06\/10\/this-is-not-spam.html","title":"This is not spam!","content":"\t\t\t\tThis is not spam!\n                    Posted on 10 Jun 2013 | Categories:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Life\n\t\t\t  by Paul Willard\nSo it\u2019s 6:41pm and I\u2019m on a train destined for Papakura before jumping the car to head home.\nIt\u2019s the end of day one as VP of operations (that\u2019s what Americans call an operations manager :) ) at SMX (smxemail.com){: target=\u201d_blank\u201d} - Oh, note SMX is NZ owned :) but I\u2019ve not been a VP of anything so colour me chuffed :)\nThe commute to work was a bit stressful when I jumped on the train to hear over the PA \u201c10 to 15 minute delay due to a fault at Sylvia park\u201d, but my stress was soon gone when greeted by a cheerful Kate (oh gawd I hope I got her name right - Remembering names is the hardest bit about day one)\nI feel strangely at home, amongst the nerds of the world. Brings back fond memories of my time at NetValue and iTouch.\nYou find the geeks, the nerds, the socially awkward, the deep thinkers, the zealots, the demanding sales people - This is where stuff happens !!!!\nExcited for day two !

Susan and I seem to have built a strong foundation of communication; so even though we don\u2019t get the sneaky lunches together like we used to, we still text\/call everyday.\nThe weekend affairs haven\u2019t changed much, most of the time in the weekends is dedicated to time with Susan.\nFamily life\nWell thank the heavens I have a responsible daughter at home, and a resourceful daughter who left home last year. I\u2019m also very blessed to have girls that actually do love me, and like to see me succeed :)\nAnd of course they are both old enough to mostly cope on their own. If they were younger I couldn\u2019t do this as a single parent.\nPersonal life\nI\u2019ve become a bit picky with my free time. Last month I\u2019d go dancing twice a week; this month I text a couple of my favourite dance partners and check they are going to be there before deciding to go :)\nBut unplanned time with friends becomes really nice. Got a text from a friend this weekend \u201cwhere are you?\u201d\u201d \u201cAt the mall, want to come here and I\u2019ll buy you a coffee\u201d which resulted in an hour (or maybe more) of sitting in a coffee shop chatting, It was really nice.\nHousework is tough though! Susan having young kids; and as a result a full and busy life, means its been over a month since I have spent an entire weekend at home. I have a big new tv, a humongous comfy bed, and other stuff, which I miss. I find myself staying up late on week days to get laundry done because I know I won\u2019t have time at the weekends. I got a bit upset this weekend, but I\u2019m not sure I expressed myself properly, which meant I spent half the weekend away from home - again. Maybe late August I can spend some time at home?\nI enjoy the things I do, I\u2019m just feeling a little home sick. Would be nice for people (like my mother for instance) to want to visit me, rather than me having to run around after others. I\u2019ve got a nice home, hot coffee, comfy couches - Come visit me? (Thanks Warren, you always visit !!! ) Of course it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m never home - Mmm tricky, I\u2019m not sure how to solve this one.\nHobbies\nApparently I own a motorbike? I can\u2019t remember :(\nI still dance weekly.\nTramping ? Yeah well - Next.\nI forget any thing else???\nSleep\nThat\u2019s what the train is for.

This of course, spurred me on even more in my quest to buck against the norms of society :) (yep I\u2019m a bad-ass)\nAnyways, I\u2019m pretty hooked on the idea now. As each day passes I grow more attached to the face rug, and have started to now picture myself as \u201cbearded\u201d.\nThe whole experience so far has exposed me to all sorts of reactions from people.

A very memorable weekend.\n\t\t  "},{"url":"https:\/\/www.loudas.com\/family\/general%20life\/2018\/03\/21\/the-willard-super-chill-living-room.html","title":"The Willard super chill living room","content":"\t\t\t\tThe Willard super chill living room\n                    Posted on 21 Mar 2018 | Categories:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFamily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Life\n\t\t\t  by Paul Willard\nSo Helen and I have been trying to create a super chill living environment :)\nFirst the fish tank, now for some old school music in the background.\nSo far I\u2019m really digging this old school LPs thing :) who knew!\nBasically we have no records (actually we have 5), but it gives us something to search for on the interwebs.\nHere\u2019s a wee video\n\t\t  "},{"url":"https:\/\/www.loudas.com\/family\/outdoors\/2018\/06\/19\/snowboarding-new-winter-2018-hobby.html","title":"Snowboarding - New winter 2018 hobby","content":"\t\t\t\tSnowboarding - New winter 2018 hobby\n                    Posted on 19 Jun 2018 | Categories:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFamily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutdoors\n\t\t\t  by Paul Willard\nSo Winter 2018 is here, and with it, an invitation to go to France for Christmas !\nA White Christmas! and some time in the snow. Of course I don\u2019t know how to ski or snowboard. Helen has been skiing before, but me, nothing.\nSo we better learn this snowboarding bizzo before we go on holiday. So this weekend we went for our first day snowboard lesson at Whakapapa.\nThere was lots of falling over, lots of laughs, and HEAPS of fun!\nWe had 4 hours of lesson where we learnt:\nToe Sliding\n  Heel Sliding\n  Skating and one foot riding\n  Getting on and off a magic carpet (in preparation for the chair lift)\n  And started with our turns\nThe photo makes me look really grumpy, but I wasn\u2019t!

Basically every weekend this winter we\u2019ve been to the mountain.\nI\u2019ve progressed pretty fast, from never snowboarding in my life, to tackling a black diamond run (even though it was completely by mistake).\nThis weekend (August 25th, 2018) we heading to the mountain once again; Whakapapa road was only allowing vehicles with chains, including 4WDs. Of course I left my chains at home ! So we headed to Turoa for the first time ever.\nTuroa in the morning\nNice drive up Moutain Road, really pretty scenery, with snow dusting the trees.\nI stopped a got a couple of pics of Helen on the mountain:\nThe visibility and crowds were both pretty bad.\nBy lunch time I\u2019d had enough of the lack of visibility; The mountain report tells me Whakapapa has better visibility so we head there.\nWhakapapa\nWell, the report was wrong !! It is BLIZZARD conditions ! But I convinced Helen we should head up to the Delta Chair.\nIt is crazy windy ! and snowing, and cold, and, well, blizzard conditions. I decide I still want to snowboard down, even though we literally cannot see the snow under our feet, and Helen follows.\nOf course I take a big tumble, and get back up with pain in my left ankle; I ignore it and carry on down the mountain, heading towards Hut Flat and the Rock Garden. Helen follows.\nWe rendezvous at the top of Rangatira Express chair; Helen bails out, she\u2019s taking the chair down, and headed towards Happy Valley, I (ignoring my now quite sore ankle) take the Rock Garden down.\nWe meet at Happy valley, and bump into Katrina, Sarah, and Ross\nWe have a few runs down Happy Valley, after 3 I decide my ankle is too sore, and needs to stop.\nHome by 7:30pm\nWell, we get home, and off comes the boots, bad news\u2026.\nSo we spend Sunday morning getting x-rays, waiting around in Accident and Emergency, to find out nothing is broken, and with some care I should be back on the mountain next weekend. Phew! Got to have a hoon around on a wheel chair though :)\n\t\t  "},{"url":"https:\/\/www.loudas.com\/contact.html","title":"Get in touch with Paul.","content":"    About Paul\n    Here\u2019s a wee bit about me.\n    Firstly about the name TerminalAddict. Many moons ago I was in a chat room (#musb on freednode) chatting with a bloke called DragonMage. DragonMage is a member of Mandrivausers.org\n    Well I was helping some people with Mandrake (or some other distro, I can\u2019t remember) and all my help was telling them to open a command line interface (CLI) which is also called a terminal, so soon enough DragonMage started saying I was addicted to the terminal.\n    The name developed from there, and I thought it was very appropriate for the following reasons\n    I use a terminal for everything\n      I am a smoker, which could be terminal, and I am addicted\n      I ride motorcycles, which could be terminal, and I am addicted\n      Many of my other hobbies \/ habits could be described the same way\n    So I stuck with the name, also it wasn\u2019t being used anywhere, by anyone else, which is pretty amazing in this day and age.\n    Here\u2019s a couple of ways you can get in contact with me:P: +6421638223E: Send me an Email\n\t\t  "},{"url":"https:\/\/www.loudas.com\/dance_videos.html","title":"Dance Videos.","content":"A small collection of some dance videos\nall my videos on Vimeo\nSianne and I competing at Cerocmania\nUna and I competing at East and South 2013\nBecks and I competing at Cerocmania\n\t\t  "},{"url":"https:\/\/www.loudas.com\/general_videos.html","title":"General Videos.","content":"A cat named Tivo playing fetch\nGeorgia\u2019s Heli flight\nPirongia Craft day entertainment\n\t\t  "}]

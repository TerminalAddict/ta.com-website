Yep it's the important issues I consider !!!

Actually this is a somewhat important topic in New Zealand really; the laws surrounding anti-piracy and what-not in NZ. Today the [NZ Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10726286&ref=facebookheadlines){: target="_blank"} published a story about libraries having to possibly remove all internet access.

It's what I have been trying to explain to people all along; there is no burden of proof, and it _will_ affect small business in NZ.  Possibly my message hasn't been getting through because I engage "rant" mode when I talking; which is probably not conducive to listening to what I have to say :)

Now I'm no saint I'll give you that, _but_, and here's my thing, if I see value then I don't mind paying .. no problem in fact, I'll pay!

Computer games for instance; I spend money, because I see value in what I'm buying, just take a look at my [Steam account](http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerminalAddict/games?tab=all){: target="_blank"}, see .. I spend money!  But if there is no value, I refuse to pay .. 

sky tv for many years took money from me, all the while slowly but surely, increasing the amount of advertising I had to sit through, the value diminished to where I could no longer stand giving them any money. Same deal with Vodafone. I was a Vodafone customer for near on a trillion years, but have just recently switch to 2degrees; better value

The real cure to this needs to be a better thought out way of selling movies, tv shows, and all this pirate nonsense. Better value !! that's what I want.

It's all related I tell ya .... fibre in our country could be an enabler to a fix for this problem. We are meant to be embracing technology, not hindering it. The current climate is heading towards stifling technology advancement!

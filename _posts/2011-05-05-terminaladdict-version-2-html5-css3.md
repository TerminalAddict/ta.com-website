## is this HTML5 and CSS3 I see before me?

Yep teh sexy. That's what HTML5 and CSS3 provide.

If you're viewing this in internet explorer version 8 or earlier you're probably wondering what wrong with my website; if you're viewing this in just about any other browser you';re probably thinking .. wicked dude, good work bustin' out the HTML5 and CSS3 :)

## Shablamo

That's the technical term .. shablamo :)

Version two I've tried a few different things

* HTML5 and CSS3 (who cares about old browsers?)
  * RGBa backgrounds and box-shadows
  * Deep integration with facebook (notice the comments are FB comments?)

Not sure what works and what doesn't yet .. guess I'll figure it our over time :)

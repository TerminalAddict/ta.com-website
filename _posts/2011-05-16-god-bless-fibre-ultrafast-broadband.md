I've long been a fan of fast internet. When I built my country home 8 years ago I paid an extra $5000 to get a huge pole installed, so I could get wireless delivered (17kms line of site). At the time this was pretty cutting edge stuff, and expensive !!! but everything in my house uses the internet; my TV (TiVo) my phones (voip) my cell phones (3 android phones in the house) plus my [idle iPad](/osx/2011/05/12/why-my-ipad-sits-idle-and-doesnt-get-used.html).

## Content, my kingdom for content

I've also been pretty good friends with the folks (or at least one of them) at [Velocity Networks](http://www.velocitynetworks.co.nz/){: target="_blank"}, so I've had my unfair share of information from network providers. Content is king !

No body wants a fast connection, just so they can say they have a fast connection (well maybe I do :) ) but really we want content don't we? TV on-demand, game servers, hosted movies, content .. content .. content! but what content?

However the NZ government seems to be working against us with an ill-informed anti-piracy law that removes any burden of proof; we're all just scared out of our wits to share anything in case we get the book thrown at us.

So how is ultrafast broadband supposed to succeed ?

More game servers? !!!!

It seems the international community is starting to notice some things in the NZ internet space. This recent story on [El reg](http://www.theregister.co.uk){: target="_blank"} & [Nz boffins anchor new submarine cable](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/22/pacific_fibre_submarine_cable/){: target="_blank"}


> New Zealand’s new US$400m submarine communications cable project, Pacific Fibre, has signed Reannz (Research & Education Advanced Network NZ) as its first customer.
> 
> The Pacific Fibre undersea cable system will connect Australia to the United States with two fibre optic cables via New Zealand and should bring more competitive pricing to the international transmission market &#8211; it will go head-to-head with the incumbent Southern Cross Cable network.

This pleases me :) Me and the internet we're like this (\*crosses fingers\*) 

So to see my precious (nah, I don't really call it that :) ) possibly developing is great news. There is a \*thing\* coming together in NZ with fibre to the home, pacific fibre !! I'm excited!

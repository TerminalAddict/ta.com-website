So todays project was shorten my URLs :)

Seems simple enough, I've been using bit.ly for a while mainly to ease my tweetdeck usage :) But last night I thought "myself" I thought "you should do your own URL shortening".

I've seen "that guy" ben do it :) [http://www.ben.geek.nz/](http://www.ben.geek.nz/){: target="_blank"} .. can't be that hard :)

So some googling around to what my options are turns out I need that sweet short domain name.

So I got [link2.nz](http://link2.nz), take a look, register and start tracking your links - **like a boss!**

> There is some stuff I don't do which maybe I should ? bad word filtering etc? not sure .. I'll think about that. If it turns into a spam fest then I will make available to registered users only.

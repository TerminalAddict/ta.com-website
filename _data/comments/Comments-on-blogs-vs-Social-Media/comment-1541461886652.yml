  The best way I've found to do it is to repost it on Facebook/whatever and
  scrape the comments then reproduce them on your site. Then you have link to
  the original comment (seeing as it's not the original attributing the source
  is good practice). Unfortunately, then you have people saying "I never posted
  on that site WTF??".

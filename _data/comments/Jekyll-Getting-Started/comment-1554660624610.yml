  Hey bro, nicely done! I wanted something more technical to read about Jekyll
  and all I found was the easiest steps using themes that I would probably have
  to pay. I dont know much about dev in general, all my skills are from
  infrastructure and linux areas but it is always good to know how to make a
  simple website without having to use Wordpress or other huge cms that I wont
  use all the tools. Thanks for taking your time and document the process, this
  means a lot for people like you and me.
